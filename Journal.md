What my design is supposed to do:

1: ask user for a noun, plural noun, number, ect.
2: use a madlibs prompt with <noun>, <plural>, ect. spiced in
3:Make a new variable (or print statement) that prints out everything before the first user inputed word, then the user inputed word, then everything after that specific word, then the next user input word ect.
4:print the new personalized mad lib.

Requirements for this program:

1: this program should work with any mad lib without changing anything but the original mad libs variable.
2:Should be tested with one of my personal mad libs and 2 other mad libs that are provided to me. All three should run as intended.
3:The code needs to have comments explaining what does what, and what I need to change.

Current Problems:
1: I dont know how to look for a second instance of a symbol using IndexOf. Theres no way to do this with any info ive gathered from the java quick reference only. Maybe if I split the string up and then look at each part of the string? But a split method isnt in the java quick reference.
